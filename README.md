Using javascript objects i created a phrase guessing game in which you have so many tries at guessing letters.

Added a scale and a box-shadow animation effect on the buttons in hover and focus state, as well as background-color and color animations when the wrong and chosen classes are added
Added a transition to the leters showing.
